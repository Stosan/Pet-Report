Depending on what‚Äôs dominant in {pet_name}‚Äôs chart, they might lean toward certain sensory preferences when it comes to food, rest, and comfort. Let‚Äôs break it down by elemental style:

- If they‚Äôve got **lots of Fire**, they might need bursts of active play before truly relaxing ‚Äî like zoomies *before* snoozies. They may love crunchy snacks that match their spicy energy!
- With **a strong Earth vibe**, comfort is king. Think soft textures, warm snuggle spots, and maybe a serious opinion on food presentation. These pets know their routines and expect excellence!
- **Airy types**? Always curious. They might graze, snack in stages, or snooze lightly in watchful spurts. They want variety and mental stimulation before full belly flops.
- **Water babies** are the moodiest napmasters. They might seek soothing sounds or hidey-holes to recharge and are often extra sensitive to how and where they eat.

We can‚Äôt promise they‚Äôll stick to a meal plan (we see you, midnight fridge raiders), but their stars reveal a lot about their ideal snack-and-snooze environment.
